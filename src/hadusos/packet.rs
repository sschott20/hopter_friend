/// The session packet is the unit of transmission at the session layer. A

/// The following figure shows the generic layout of a packet. See
/// [`PacketContent`] for the specific layout of each packet type.
///
/// ```plain
/// |<- 4 bits ->|<- 4 bits  ->|<- 8 bits ->|<- variable length ->|
/// +------------+-------------+------------+---------------------+
/// |  SEQUENCE  | ACKNOWLEDGE |    TYPE    | ..VARIABLE CONTENT..|
/// +------------+-------------+------------+---------------------+
/// |<--------------  HEADER -------------->|<----- CONTENT ----->|
/// ```
///
/// The packet can detect transmission error. If a packet losses bytes or gains
/// spurious bytes during transmission, or if no more than three bits get
/// flipped, parsing the packet will result in an error
/// ([`PacketError::Clobbered`]).
///
/// The `sequence` field has two variants: `even` and `odd`. A sender
/// alternates the `sequence` between `even` and `odd` when sending data to the
/// receiver. For other non-data packet, the `sequence` is set to `even` as a
/// sanity check.
///
/// The `acknowledge` field conveys the confirmation from a receiver to the
/// sender, which can be either `ack` or `nack`. The receiver replies `ack`
/// when a received packet is well-formed, otherwise `nack`. The replied packet
/// carries the same `sequence` as the previously received data packet.
///
/// The `acknowledge` field is meaningful only when a receiver replies
/// confirmation to the sender. In all other cases the field is set to `ack` as
/// a sanity check.
///
/// The `type` field has four variants, representing four packet types:
/// `send_request`, `send_clearance`, `data`, and `reset`.
///
/// A prospective sender initiates a session by sending a `send_request` packet
/// to the receiver. If the receiver is ready, it will reply with a
/// `send_clearance` packet. This procedure forms a handshake. Additionally,
/// the `send_request` packet conveys the totel length of the data to be sent,
/// so that the receiver can allocate a buffer accordingly.
///
/// After the initial handshake, the sender and receiver then proceed to
/// exchange packets of `data` type. The `data` packets from the sender have
/// non-zero content length, which is the data being sent. In contrast, the
/// `data` packets from the receiver have zero content length, which is used to
/// deliver `ack` or `nack` confirmation. To reduce confusion, we call the
/// `data` packet from the receiver to the sender as acknowledge packet.
///
/// A `data` packet always carries as much data as possible, up to the `data`
/// payload size limit ([`MAX_DATA_PACKET_PAYLOAD_SIZE`]). Since both
/// transmission party know the total data length, they will also share a
/// consensus of the total number of `data` packet.
///
/// The sender terminates a session when it receives `ack` for the last `data`
/// packet from the receiver, upon which the sender sends a `reset` packet.
/// The receiver does not reply to the `reset` packet.
///
/// If a session cannot be established or proceed due to serious transmission
/// errors, either the sender or the receiver may send a `reset` packet to
/// abort the session.
///
/// Since the correctness of the header is critical to the protocol, the
/// header uses 4 bits to encode every 1 bit, so three or less bit flips can be
/// detected. The data content is protected by a crc32 checksum, which can also
/// detect up to three bit flips.
